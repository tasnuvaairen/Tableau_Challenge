Citibike  Analysis


I took 12 months data for the year 2019
1.	Since the data was too large, I cleaned the data in excel and took a portion of time of everyday
2.	In tableau, I added the 12 months’ data and put them in an “Union” So that they are combined under same columns. 
3.	I used the station latitude and longitude to display the start statins and end stations locations on the NYC map
4.	I displayed graphs for top 10 starting and ending stations and bottom 10 starting and ending stations based on the number of trips they take in total. 
5.	I also displayed some graphs based on age and gender data and the number of trips they take on an average. 
6.	Later on, there is a dashboard displaying the interactive demographic information
7.	There is another dashboard displaying the station maps, where you can select your desired station and locate it on the map
8.	There is a city map, which displays the popular stations (the circles are larger as the popularity goes up) the city is also displays population based on zip code
9.	The story summarizes the starting stations total locations, top 10 and bottom 10 locations as well
10.	Most popular station dashboard can select the stations based on the their location on the map
11.
